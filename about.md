Hello, my name is Josh Benner. I'm what in the industry, they call a "full stack" developer. In reality it's probably closer to two thirds or three quarters ;-P

Currently I am an engineer at CDK Global, Inc. in downtown Seattle, WA. We're always hiring. Please let me know if you or someone you know wants to build amazing websites that build amazing websites for other people.

In the recent past I have done some analytics dashboard development. I have experience with SQL, NoSQL, Docker. I've even dabbled in ElasticSearch. I have contributed to open source projects, led JavaScript study groups and volunteered as a mentor at [Nodeschool Seattle](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-NodeSchool/) meetups.

Anyway... I love reading and writing and talking about technology, open source software, cryptography, distributed computing, IoT -- and all the other things. If you found this page, I'm sure you can track me down in the other corners of the internet.
