Hello, my name is Josh Benner.  I'm a full stack developer.  Or I was.  Now I'm maybe two thirds or three quarters on account of all the emails and the meetings.  

Currently I am writing server side JavaScript at CDK Global, Inc. in downtown Seattle, WA.  It's a great place to work.  Get in touch if you or someone you know wants to build amazing websites that build amazing websites for other people.

In the recent past I built an LMS analytics dashboard web app from scratch.  I have experience with SQL, NoSQL, Docker, ElasticSearch...  I have contributed to open source projects, led JavaScript study groups and volunteered as a mentor at [Nodeschool Seattle](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-NodeSchool/) meetups.

To prove my love of reading and writing and talking about technology, open source software, cryptography, distributed computing, IoT -- and all the other things, I started this blog.  If you found it, I'm sure you can track me down in the other corners of the internet.
